                Here's an HTML table with transportation rates for Buckeye Medical Transport in Ohio, including the requested service types and rate columns. The table is properly formatted with `<thead>` and `<tbody>` tags, and includes some basic styling classes.

```html
<table class="rate-table">

```

You can style the table further by adding CSS classes to the `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements. Here's an example of some basic styling:

```css
.rate-table {
  width: 100%;
  border-collapse: collapse;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

.rate-table th, .rate-table td {
  padding: 8px;
  text-align: left;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
}

.rate-table th {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
}

.rate-table tr:hover {
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
}
```

This CSS will give the table a clean, modern look with alternating row colors on hover. You can further customize the styles to match the branding and design of Buckeye Medical Transport.
